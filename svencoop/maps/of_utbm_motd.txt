Opposing Force: Under the Black Moon
====================================
v1.5.1
by B-dama

You are Private Daniel Shephard, a new recruit of the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit. Your brother Adrian became a Corporal in less than 3 years- very few people have ever become a officer that quickly.

After crash landing on your way to Black Mesa, you find yourself stranded and your comrades never made it.
As a lowly grunt you have been given the perfect opportunity to prove yourself and show that Adrian isn't the only successful one in the family. Escape an infested research facility with aliens and a whole battalion of Black Ops... its going to be hell.
