"My employers are not trusting you... and rather than offer you a job we've decided to offer you a battle you have no chance of winning..."

Take the job. All that you had to do was just take the job. But, no. There was no job. And you also decided that your pride was more sacred than your safety. Who cares about safety when you can respawn? And thanks to a failed rescue attempt by the Vortigaunts you are back right where you started... four kilometers underground in the darkest corner of the Black Mesa Research Facility.

When you regain your consciousness, sirens and screams are all you hear as you wake up to the reality of utter chaos and destruction. Corpses lie mangled in pools of their own blood.

Hallways and staircases are sealed â€“ collapsed by airstrikes. To top it all off, most of the inhabitants of Xen have used their natural instinct to migrate here since their destruction is imminent, and rifts in space time continue to throw Xen creatures into the bowels of Black Mesa, and now the Race X is beginning to show more presence than ever before as well. 

Now you are trapped in an alien-infested hole in the ground with only one objective - reach the surface alive. Unfortunately, that may not be as easy as it sounds, because the Black Ops has decided that rather than kill every witness individually, they are going to simply seal off all of the exits... and then set off a thermal nuclear weapon, wiping aliens, civilians and stranded military alike.

Now it's a race against the clock as you fight your way through infested alien nesting grounds and military blockades while constantly trying to reach the surface and get out of here alive. Hopefully you can make it to the surface soon, because in about 12 hours, the entire facility will be reduced to radioactive dust.

"No regrets."
